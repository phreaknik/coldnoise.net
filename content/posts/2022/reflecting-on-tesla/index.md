title = 'Time for a Change: Leaving Tesla'
+++
I recently made the difficult decision to leave Tesla.

My time there was nothing short of amazing. I had the privilege of working with
a truly world-class team in the Autopilot Hardware group, where I helped
develop firmware and device drivers for in-car autopilot systems, as well as
firmware for the AI training datacenter. We worked on cutting-edge technologies
that could only exist in our lab, built by our exceptional team. I'm pretty
sure we set a few world records along the way, though I can't share the
details ðŸ˜­. Suffice to say, it was incredibly fun and fulfilling work.

I worked remotely from Texas for a team based in California. While remote work
was great in many ways, I came to realize that to truly succeed on that team, I
would need to relocate to California -- something I couldn't ask of my family.
Given that realization, leaving was the right choice, even though it was a
tough one to make.

Fortunately, an equally exciting opportunity building wearable devices landed
on my plate. I look forward to sharing more about that in a future post!
